<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Stanford University Research Consent Form</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Protocol Director:</strong>&nbsp;Dr&nbsp; Anthony D Wagner . Department of Psychology and Neurosciences Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-2130. Phone 650-723-4048.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> You are invited to participate in a research study that aims to assess how the brain supports language and memory in younger and older healthy adults. We hope to learn more about the brain and cognitive mechanisms that support these cognitive abilities. As a healthy volunteer, you have been asked to participate in this study because our objective is to understand the cognitive functions supported by the healthy human brain.<br />
<br />
If you decide to participate, the procedure will be described to you in the written task instructions. You will be asked to either passively attend to or actively respond in one or more of the following experimental conditions:<br />
1. Passive watching or listening to stimulus information (e.g., visually presented patterns, visually or auditorally presented words or numbers);<br />
2. Watching or listening to stimuli and making a response (e.g., a finger response) about the type of stimuli seen or heard;</p>

<p>Some of the stimuli used in the experiment may have an affective component (i.e., pleasant or unpleasant words), while others will be affectively neutral.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As your participation in the experiment is voluntary, you are free to discontinue the experiment at any point.</p>

<p>At the discretion of the protocol director subjects may be taken out of this study due to unanticipated circumstances. Some possible reasons for withdrawal are:</p>

<p>- failure to follow instructions<br />
- the investigator decides that continuation would be harmful to you<br />
- the study is canceled<br />
- not meeting inclusion criteria</p>

<p>- other administrative reasons</p>

<p>If you are apprehensive about one aspect of the procedure, or if you desire to have more information about the procedure, you should ask the investigator any questions you have about the procedure and request that they respond satisfactorily to your questions.</p>

<p><strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</strong> Your participation in this experiment will take between 10 and 180 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</strong> There are no known significant risks or benefits associated with participation in this study. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.</p>

<p>If you are asked to perform tasks involving virtual environments, you may experience symptoms of motion sickness. We do not anticipate that these symptoms will be more extreme than those experienced through routine activities such as playing video games or riding in a car. If you experience any symptoms of motion sickness, let the experimenter know.</p>

<p><strong>PAYMENTS:</strong> As compensation for your participation, you will be paid $7.5 / hour based on expected task completion time after your responses are screened. Some studies may also pay an additional performance-based bonus.</p>

<p>If you do not complete the task,&nbsp;or we feel that you completed it to an unsatisfactory standard (i.e. you do not follow the instructions), you will not be compensated. This policy is in line with payment &nbsp;standards for online studies. There is no cost to you for this study.</p>

<p><strong>SUBJECT&#39;S RIGHTS: </strong>If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study.</p>

<p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY:</strong></p>

<p>This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers with this Certificate may not disclose or use information, documents, or biospecimens that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other action, suit, or proceeding, or be used as evidence, for example, if there is a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use. Information, documents, or biospecimens protected by this Certificate cannot be disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the research except, if there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to report child abuse or communicable diseases but not for federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, see below); if you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or if it is used for other scientific research, as allowed by federal regulations protecting research subjects.</p>

<p>The Certificate cannot be used to refuse a request for information from personnel of the United States federal or state government agency sponsoring the project that is needed for auditing or program evaluation by NIH which is funding this project or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&nbsp; You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If you want your research information released to an insurer, medical care provider, or any other person not connected with the research, you must provide consent to allow the researchers to release it.</p>
